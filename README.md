**Loan Approval Prediction Linear Regression Analysis**

**Overview**
This project applies linear regression to predict loan approval decisions using a synthetic dataset of 50,000 loan applications from US and Canadian financial institutions. The dataset incorporates realistic banking criteria including credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and employment history. (from the dataset description) 

**Research question**
To what extent do years employed, current debt, and occupation status influence loan approval?
